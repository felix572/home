1. GRANT OF LICENSE
1.1 In consideration of You agreeing to abide by, and subject to Your compliance with, all of the terms and conditions contained in this EULA, Schneider Electric grants to You a non-exclusive non-transferable, royalty-free, limited, world-wide (except for Japan for which a separate license right to use the Software Product must be purchased), license right to use the Software Product described in the Documentation or in the About/Installer Box, related to said Software Product for the term identified therein and in accordance with the license model identified therein. The Software Product may only be used for purposes of Your ordinary business on the applicable number of nodes, by the particular named user(s), in the particular location(s), on the particular device(s) and/or on the particular system(s) for which You have been licensed such Software Product, as those number of nodes, location(s), device(s) and/or system(s) are identified in the Documentation or in the About/Installer Box. If the Documentation, or the About/Installer Box fail to state a duration/term of the license granted hereunder, such duration/term shall be deemed to be one (1) year from the date the Software Product is delivered to You (unless a trial license, in which case the duration/term shall be deemed to be thirty (30) days). The Software Product will be provided to You in object code (machine-readable) form only and under no circumstances is Schneider Electric obligated to disclose the source code of the Software Product to You, unless such obligation is required in accordance with Section 11. The Software Product (including the related Documentation) is licensed to You and not sold to You.
1.2 This EULA describes and governs Your right to install and use the Software Product. It is expressly agreed that the terms and conditions of this EULA will prevail over and supersede the terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or purchasing document issued or submitted by You; and the terms and conditions of any purchase order or purchasing document issued by You are expressly rejected by Schneider Electric to the extent inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this EULA. 
1.3 Upon expiry of the trial period or, in case of a non-perpetual license upon expiry of the limited period of time for which the license was granted to You, Your license to the Software Product will automatically and immediately terminate, unless a further license is obtained from Schneider Electric. Consequently, the Software Product might automatically be de-installed and/or rendered unusable (with or without prior warning).
1.4 You acknowledge that if You need to activate the Software Product through the use of internet or telephone, toll and/or internet charges may apply and will be at Your cost.
1.5 If technological measures are designed/incorporated to prevent unlicensed or illegal use of the Software Product, You agree that Schneider Electric may use those measures and You agree to comply with any requirements regarding such technological measures. Such measures do not constitute a defect in the Software Product nor do they entitle You to any warranty rights.
1.6 Unless You have acquired a Corporate License as expressly defined in this EULA, floating, concurrent or shared use of the Software Product is not permitted, and the use of the Software Product shall be licensed under this EULA as a Single User License or a Multiple User License.

A Single User License can only be installed and used on a single node or a single personal computer, tablet, smartphone or similar device (hereinafter “Device”), at any given time and is prohibited from being installed and used on a network or any other multi-station computer system that allows simultaneous use by several users. 
1.8 Notwithstanding the above Section, You may download and use the Software Product on more than one single Device if: (i) the Software Product is a mobile application (app) and (ii) if said Devices are all used by You under the same user account under which the application was initially downloaded. 
1.9 The Multiple User License applies when a label affixed on the Software Product’s media itself, in its About/Installer Box or Documentation or elsewhere state: ”Multiple User License". A Multiple User License allows concurrent and unrestricted number of installations of the corresponding Software Product on several nodes, personal computers or similar Devices, on a network or any other multi-station computer system, unless a Multiple User License restricts the number of nodes or users to the number defined for the corresponding purchased and registered Software Product. Where You would use a Multiple User License via a network or any other multi-station computer system, it shall be Your responsibility to put in place such means as necessary to guarantee that all restrictions set forth in this EULA are followed.

NOTHING IN THIS EULA SHALL LIMIT OR EXCLUDE SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC’S LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY ARISING OUT OF SCHNEIDER ELECTRIC’S NEGLIGENCE OR FOR ITS FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.
10.7 In case the Software Product is intended as per its Documentation to be used for the purpose of collecting, storing and/or processing data such as but not limited to personal individual information, it is Your sole and full responsibility when making such use of the Software that You comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations.

10.8 The limitations or exclusions of warranties and liability contained in this EULA shall apply only to the extent permitted by the law applicable to this EULA and, in particular, do not affect or prejudice the statutory rights which, as the case may be, will benefit You under any mandatory or public order laws or regulation applicable in any such country (on either federal or state level, when applicable).
10.9 In case the Software Product was furnished to You by any authorized reseller or other sales representative or another third party supplying the Software Product with or without a third party product, Schneider Electric shall in no event be a party to any purchase order or other agreement between You and such third party and shall not assume or otherwise bear any liability thereunder, with the consequence that any and all claims You may have in relation to the Software Products shall be directed at such third party and shall be subject to the liability sections in any purchase order or other agreement between You and such third party.

Schneider Electric will have no obligation to You under this Section relating to claims which arise outside of the Included Jurisdiction, nor for any claims not expressly set out in Section 10.10 above.

17.3 No failure or delay on the part of either You or Schneider Electric in the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.

The successful or prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert witness fees and other costs of arbitration, in addition to such other relief to which it may be entitled.

18.3 You acknowledge and accept that Schneider Electric will be irreparably damaged (and damages at law may be an inadequate remedy) if You breach any provision of this EULA and such provision is not specifically enforced. Therefore, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by You of this EULA, Schneider Electric shall be entitled, in addition to all other rights or remedies, to (a) an injunction or other injunctive relief restraining such breach, without being required to show any actual damage or to post an injunction or other bond; or (b) a decree for specific performance of the applicable provision of this Agreement; or (c) both to the extent permitted by applicable law in the country where Schneider Electric has its registered office or principal place of business and/or, as relevant in the context, where You will install, copy, run or otherwise use the Software Product, on either federal or state level when applicable.
